# Python while loop.
#  While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in python is as follows:
"""
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("Hello Mosses", number)
    number = number + 1

print("========================================")
# print a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop

number3 = 50
while number3 <= 70 :
    print("Hello world", number3)
    number3 = number3 + 2
